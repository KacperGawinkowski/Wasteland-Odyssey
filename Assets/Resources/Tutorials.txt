Quest objectives are written in the upper right corner of your screen. <br><br>Complete the quest objective.
Now, before you head out on your adventure, go out from your house and loot the chest.
Press "I" key or the backpack icon in the upper right corner of your screen. <br><br>Press RMB on the weapon or armor and equip it.
Press "H" key or the heart icon in the upper right corner of your screen to check your health status.
As you can see your body is slightly damaged, go to your inventory and use medicaments.
Press "1" or "2" to switch between guns and "R" to reload the weapon. <br><br>Ammunition is not infinite so use it wisely.
Somewhere near your house there is a partially destroyed mech, find it and destroy it. <br><br>Press LMB on the mech to shoot at it.
Mechs cannot be looted, but if you ever kill a human then you will be able to look it just like you looted the chest.
Now you know the basics, so head out on your adventure. <br><br>Go to the edge of the map to leave your house location.
